                After  this time, you can resume your normal skincare and cleansing routine, but be sure to pat your brows dry rather than rubbing them.
                Use a Gentle Cleanser. When cleansing your face, be sure to use a gentle cleanser that would not irritate your skin or strip away the tint. 
                Avoid using products that contain exfoliating ingredients, such as alpha-hydroxy acids, for the first few days after your treatment.
                Apply Sunscreen to o protect your skin and keep your brow tint looking its best. Look for a broad-spectrum formula with an SPF of 30 or higher.
                Avoid Using Oil-Based Products, such as makeup removers or heavy creams, can cause the tint to fade or run. If possible, avoid using these products on or near your brows, or use a gentler alternative.
